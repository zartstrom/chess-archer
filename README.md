Analyze a game of chess with an engine

### Motivation
I want to

* analyze my game when coming home on sunday night
* write Go code

On Linux I have not found a chess program that I really like, so why not write one myself?!

Harpa is a music hall and a convention Center in Reykjav√≠k, its architecture is great and it hosts an annual chess tournament.

### Principles
harpa-chess is

* simple
* robust

### Milestones

* Connect stockfish output via a websocket to html
* Convert stockfish lines in a more human readable format
* Get a javascript chessboard
